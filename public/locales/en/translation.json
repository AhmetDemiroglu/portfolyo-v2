    "p1": "I am Ahmet Demiroğlu. I am an Urban Planner, a graduate of Gazi University, Faculty of Architecture, Department of City and Regional Planning, and a Real Estate Appraiser with nine years of field and inspection experience. During this time, I improved my planning and analysis skills and gained experience in paying attention to detail and reporting. I took my professional experience one step further by obtaining the Certified Appraiser license.",
    "p2": "I have been deeply curious about computers and technology since my childhood. During my university years, I had the opportunity to improve myself in the drawing and design programs that I actively used for my department. However, my strong interest in software development eventually led me to make a significant shift in my career. I decided to leave the real estate sector, where I had gained substantial experience, and focus on developing myself in the field of full-stack web development.",
    "p3": "In line with this goal, I successfully completed the Software Specialization Training at Neos Software Academy. This training covered programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#, as well as popular libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap, React.js, and .NET. Thanks to the 7-week intensive internship program I completed in July 2023, I reinforced my theoretical knowledge with practical applications and successfully launched a fully functional rent a car website project from start to finish. In this project, I took an active role in both front-end and back-end development, gaining experience in all layers of web applications. During my internship, I also took part in the process of preparing a domestic and open-source CSS and JS library within Neos Software.",
    "p4": "In May 2025, I began working as a Front-end Developer at SedBim Bilişim. In this role, I actively participate in the development and maintenance of existing corporate projects using Vue.js, while also enhancing my skills in the React ecosystem through new projects. When needed, I also support C#-based back-end services with .NET Core, making sure to maintain my full-stack perspective.",
    "p5": "While deepening my front-end expertise in my current role, I am also strengthening my knowledge of React (both through projects at work and personal projects I develop in my spare time). My problem-solving mindset, combined with the analytical perspective from my previous career, enables me to adapt quickly to new technologies. I aim to continuously improve myself by closely following industry innovations and adding value to the projects I work on."
